AmpacheXL

Overview

A webOS app for Ampache written in the enyo framework and designed for use on a tablet. The app takes some inspiration and tiny bit of code from the Ampache Mobile app, though it was written from scratch using a completely different framework.

WARNING: This app requires an Ampache Server to connect to. That means you will be responsible for installing and configuring your very own web server. Setting up Ampache is not a hard task but it's also not trivial. If you are a beginner be sure to read up and look to the forums for help and be prepared to spend some time.
